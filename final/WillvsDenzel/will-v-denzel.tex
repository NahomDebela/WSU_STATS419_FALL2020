\vspace{5mm}

\noindent In order to find out who the better actor is I had to
determine which features were relevant for comparing these actors. I did
not want to compare the movie profit related to each of the actors
because I believe that a larger profit margin implies more fan appeal,
advertising, or simply popularity. This doesn't answer my research
question of who is the better actor. I couldn't simply choose who had
more movies or who has more experience because that doesn't fit the
definition of `better.' The formal definition of better is ``of a more
excellent or effective type or quality.'' Although these actors are both
talented in their own right, my analysis has led me to the conclusion
that \_\_\_ is a better actor than \_\_\_.

\noindent Both Will Smith and Denzel Washington are currently starring
in films. Will, who is 52 years old began acting in films in 1992. While
Denzel, Who is 60 years old began acting in films in 1981. In this
report I compare these actors by multiple factors both directly relating
to the movies ranking themselves and by the crew members each actor had
available to them. I believe to objectively determine who is a better
actor I must not only compare the actors side by side, but also the
level of help each actor had in the movies. I compared the directors,
co-Stars, and writers of both Will and Denzel's movies to see the true
effectiveness they had in their films.

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\noindent In conclusion I pick Will Smith as the better actor over
Denzel Washington. Throughout my analysis I noticed that Denzel
Washington overall had a higher average rating than Will Smith. Both
these actors are very talented, however in order to compare them I must
compare their performances and take into account the talent that was
around them in the process. This is where I noticed a significant
difference between the actors. I decided that because Will Smith had far
less talent around him and only had a slight drop off in average rating:
Will Smith is the better actor. I can suggest that as an actor increases
the talent around them, the ratings of the movies increase. This is
exactly the case between these two actors.

\vspace{7mm}

\noindent Denzel Washington has starred in about 25\% more movies than
Will Smith. Additionally, in every case he has had far more prominent
writers, directors, and co-stars than will smith. Of course this is
expected since he has more movies. However, if these artists had the
same amount of talent around them, the ratio should only be about 4:3.
This is not the case. This was especially noticable in the directors and
writers for these actors. Denzel has had significantly more prominent
directors than Will. Denzel has had 9 directors who have headlined at
least 15 times as a director, compared to Smith's 2. Also Denzel has had
significantly more prominent writers than Will. Denzel has had 5 writers
who have headlined at least 15 times as a writer, compared to Will's 2.
That is about a much larger ratio in favor of Denzel.

\vspace{7mm}

\noindent Overall, It was very difficult to choose between these two
actors. Though undoubtedly, the evidence is there. With less prominent
Co-Stars, Writers and directors Will Smith was able to star in movies
that were on average rated 6.5, compared to Denzels 6.9. That is only a
.4 drop off compared to Denzels average movie rating. This difference is
not all that significant to simply choose Denzel, so, by collecting more
information such as their cast mates rankings I was able to narrow down
the features that determine who the `better' actor is: Will Smith.
